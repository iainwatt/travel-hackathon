Trees App 
=============    

**About**
This project was completed by Iain Watt and Mary Walz (the dynamic due) as part of a 24hr Hackathon at General Assembly, March 2015, London, UK. The app is by no means finished and was very much a learning experience for both authors.  

**Motivation**
The idea behind this project was to create an app that allowed a user to search for and browse through a selection of the finest trees both in his/her local area and worldwide. It also allows users to upload images and information on trees that will appear on the map and make that information available to all. 

**Contributions**
At this time only the authors but if anyone wishes to take this very basic app and expand on its UX and functionality it would be to the benefit of trees and tree lovers worldwide.
